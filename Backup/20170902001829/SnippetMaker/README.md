SnippetMaker for Sublime Text 2 and 3
========

Makes managing snippets easy. Create snippets on the fly, and manage them without digging into a file manager:

* Select text and use `Make Snippet` via the Command Palette to make a new snippet.
* `Edit Snippet` let's you select a snippet file to open and edit. (ST3+ only)
* Use `Delete Snippet` to send a snippet you no longer need to the trash.
